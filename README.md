The Automated Handrail Sanitization Robot is a compact hygiene device designed to disinfect  stairwell railings in public spaces. Handrails are touched by thousands daily, making them hotspots for harmful bacteria and viruses. Unlike manual cleaning, which is time-consuming and irregular, this robot provides continuous and effective sanitization.
